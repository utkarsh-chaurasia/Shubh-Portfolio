# Shubh-Portfolio

As a web developer, I had the opportunity to work on a paid project for a client who wanted to showcase his work online. I designed and developed a portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, demonstrating my skills in web development.

The website features a clean and modern design, with easy navigation and a responsive layout for seamless viewing on different devices. It includes a section for the client's bio, a list of his skills and expertise, and a showcase of his work, including images and descriptions.

Throughout the project, I worked closely with the client to ensure that his vision was incorporated into the design and functionality of the website. I maintained regular communication with the client to address his feedback and make any necessary changes.

I also provided hosting services for the website, ensuring that it was accessible online and that it loaded quickly and smoothly for optimal user experience.
